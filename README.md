Game summery: 
We created a one-off stylized Text Adventure where you as a colonist make your way back to your ship, and get off the planet. There will be 6 rounds of 3 randomly determined multiple choice responses. Your score is influenced by yout time, so choose quickly, and have fun!


This is product is for entertaiment. Live the fantasy of living on Mars, and having it go very wrong. The goal is to have fun, show off to friends how quickly YOU can escape from Martians.
