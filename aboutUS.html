        <p>I am currently a student at code fellows. My background is in software development. I am adept in HTML, Javascript and CSS. I have experience with Github, and Chrome DEV tools, and how to look at code to find bugs. I have also done some customer service gigs, so I know how to work on a team, and to understand what a customer is looking for in a product.</p>

        <p>My name is Ellen!  I discovered programming in grad school, where I found that I really loved the coding aspect of my quantitative analysis courses.  After I graduated, I worked as a Data Analyst at a state agency.  I found that my favorite part of the job was writing and verifying SQL queries with the data engineer from IT, so I chose to become a software developer!  Right now I'm a student at Code Fellows, where I help hypothetical salmon cookie bakers make beautiful websites that keep track of their sales data.</p>

        <p>I’m a student of Code Fellows working toward Software Developer certification.  I have over 15 years of experience working in technical support in the area of Computer Aided Design and Visualization software.  Because of this experience I’ve become a skilled problem solver and troubleshooter. Areas I have a lot of interest in are tools for modeling and designing, virtualized desktops, and cloud technology.  Do you have any suggestions on how I could best position myself for a role in these fields? I’m interested in these fields because of the transformative nature of technology and design on the human experience.</p>

        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Kate.  I'm currently student at the Code Fellows.  I'm study codding and for 401 I picked program language Python.  Before Code Fellows I used to work at Blueprint Technology in Bellevue Washington as customer service agent. It's nice company but I didn't see there any career opportunity and I decided continue education and go to school.  I have degree in the banking space but it's not what I really wanted to do. So I decided try myself in coding.  I chose Software Development because I think technology can change our world and make it better, I always wanted be part of this.</p>

        <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally</p>
